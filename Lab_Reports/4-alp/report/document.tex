	\section{Part I - Display HEX on 7-Segment Display}
	In this experiment, I've converted each hexadecimal number from 0-a into their 7-segment equivalent and stored in memory. We have 4 buttons which are for display 0, increment displayed number, decrement displayed number and blank displayed number respectively. I have created a pointer and on each key click, I change this pointer according to the key clicked.

	\section{Part II - Display Group ID on 7-Segment Display}
	In this experiment, I've stored "GrouP0" on the memory in a form that to be shown on the 7-segment display. Since it has 6 digits, we had to split into 2 rows cause it exceeds 32 bits. First row consists $HEX_{3}$ to $HEX_{0}$  and second row consists $HEX_{5}$ and $HEX_{4}$. Therefore, in first row I have stored "ouP0" and in second row I have stored "Gr". In execution, I summed first row with the class id to update our class id and show on 7-segment display.

	\section{Part III - Display 2 Words with Delay}
	In this experiment, I have converted words assigned to me which are "SEt" and "tÄ±me" to 7-segment form and change between these numbers after some delay. I have created a flag to check which word is currently showed on 7-segment display. If any key is pressed, then it stops switching words.
